# WhatsApp Clone

This is my very first project on Github. A fully functioning full stack Web App.
I call it WhatsApp Clone because it is like WhatsApp except that its crapier.
It is completely free to clone or download and modify for any use whatsoever.
The entire App runs on a single page, the JavaScript is pure with no Libraries or Frameworks. So it's beginner friendly.

## Configurations

When you download or clone this project, there are a few things you must change in order for it to work

1. Manually create a Database with your prefered name and then import the countries.sql file located in the root of this repository as the very first table, The rest of the tables in the database would be generated when needed. Do not alter the countries.sql file even by name.
2. Change the `CONN` values for the [src/Config.php](https://github.com/julius-ek-hub/whatsapp-clone/blob/b6a90a955782b8ea92fb90b4ae74ccc7f145b587/src/Config.php#L9 "Config.php") to match the settings of your local or remote Database connections.
